**Tom, a CST junior**

***

Tom, age 20, is a CST major junior at Temple University. On top of achieving dean's list each semester, Tom is also the vice president of the ACM club. Tom also spends a large portion of his free time working on his own programming projects and browsing open-source code managers like GitHub. Tom is a large supporter of automation and frequently goes out of his way to learn more about emerging technologies to integrate them into his everyday life and improve his own productivity.

Tom's experience with computer science concepts at Temple combined with his own exploration into related technologies on his own time make him proficient at digital technology. He has enjoyed some of the more recent additions to Temple's Banner system, but feels that there is room for more automation.

**Sylvia, an IST freshman**
***

Sylvia, age 18, is a freshman at Temple University. She is new to both Temple and the city of Philadelphia, and she is learning her ways around the school as well as the city. Sylvia is enrolled in the "Fly in 4" program and plans to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in 4 years or less. The registration day is close, and Sylvia has yet to create a plan for next semester. Sylvia is taking 18 credits this semester and is always busy with classwork and because of that, she hasn’t been able to make any friends. She doesn’t know which classes she has to take and is stressed out not knowing what to do and she doesn’t have any friends to ask for help regarding these things. Sylvia wishes for an app or a web app she can use, that will give her plans based on her major or time preferences.
