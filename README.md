**Tom, a CST junior**

***

Tom, age 20, is a CST major junior at Temple University. On top of achieving dean's list each semester, Tom is also the vice president of the ACM club. Tom also spends a large portion of his free time working on his own programming projects and browsing open-source code managers like GitHub. Tom is a large supporter of automation and frequently goes out of his way to learn more about emerging technologies to integrate them into his everyday life and improve his own productivity.

Tom's experience with computer science concepts at Temple combined with his own exploration into related technologies on his own time make him proficient at digital technology. He has enjoyed some of the more recent additions to Temple's Banner system, but feels that there is room for more automation.
