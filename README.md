The Scheduler

Description: The Scheduler is a web app that's automates the process of signing up for classes.

proposal: The Scheduler is a program that will make the process of signing up for classes quick and easy by automating the entire thing. When a student first enters our site all
they need to do is enter their TU credentials,Major, and course numbers and The Scheduler will handle the rest. A huge appeal of this program is how custamizable it is, At the 
moment The Scheduler's functionality is very basic in that it only does its one primary function, my plan is to elaborate on foundation and make it more user freindly. Me and my
team are going to intergrate two major components. The first major component is Twilio, which is an SMS service that we are going to use to alert student if there are any issues 
during the scheduling process (I.E. Class is full, Time constraints, etc.). The second will be to give the user the option to simply insert their major and then The Scheduler  
will sign the student up for the courses based on temple recommended timeline (This will be done using a web scrapper to pull the recommend course timeline from the bulletin and then populate it into the program).
