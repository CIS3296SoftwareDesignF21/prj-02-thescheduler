## How to Build ##

**Step 1**: Download python IDE of choice. (For this project we used Pycharm by JetBrains)

**Step 2**: Download additional libraries (Flask,Selenium,Twilio)

**Side Step**: In order to test selenium code locally you will need to download the Chrome webdriver from here: 
https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads and place it the locations listed below.
            
                   -  Mac: /usr/local/bin/
                   
                   -  Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)

**Step 3**: In order for Flask to build/Run your web app you need to add the frame work. (app = Flask(__name__) and app.run)

**Step 4**: Program web wrapper pathway (I.E. code where you want the selenium code to send you)

**Step 5**: Uppload necessary files to Host site, and update web page
